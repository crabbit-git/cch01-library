# What's this then?

This is my solution for the first homework assignment of a software development course.

I've added a whole bunch of comments to the main file (library.py) to explain what I was thinking with each element of my solution. For the sake of clarity, I've also included the original library.py provided with the assignment upon which my solution was built (startpoint.py).

This is far from an ideal implementation of this sort of a program if you're measuring it by real world standards, but hopefully it serves its purpose as a somewhat conservative exploration of how if/else statements, loops, lists, and dictionaries operate in Python 3. I've made a few references to places in the code that I would do differently if I were actually developing this for a real world use case.
